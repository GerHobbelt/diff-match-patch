### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

- **apply:** Patches generated by older versions of this library will (on
  certain unicode texts) no longer apply, as the indicies do not match up cleanly.
- **patch:** Generated indices are now different, meaning patches
  generated with this change won't apply cleanly in older versions, and
  vice-versa.

- use constants for diff types instead of typescript enum
- Exports are now optimized to allow more environments to use the
  module, regardless of them prefering ESM or CJS modules. That potentially
  changes behavior slightly, thus the breaking change.
